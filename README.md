# ip-checker
My IP checker script is a web application that I built using PHP. It enables me to retrieve and store a range of information related to the IP address of my website's visitors. With this script, I am able to capture the user's IP address, country, city, and email address.

When a user visits my website, the script retrieves their IP address and uses IP geolocation databases and APIs to determine their country and city. This information is then stored in my database alongside the email address entered by the user.

The IP checker script is an invaluable tool for me as a website owner. By keeping track of my visitors and gaining insights into my audience, I can analyze trends in user location, monitor user behavior, and gain valuable insights into my website's performance.

Overall, I find my IP checker script to be a powerful tool that helps me understand my website's audience better. It provides me with insights that enable me to improve my website's performance and user experience.
